## üìç Use Cases

### Physical Pentesting

Shadow Bubble ELITE is designed for scenarios where temporarily disrupting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communications is essential to achieving physical access objectives. By flooding nearby wireless networks with randomized SSID beacons and deauthentication packets, it can destabilize and interrupt wireless connections to access points, IoT devices, and employee workstations. This can create windows of opportunity for further actions, such as cloning badges or accessing internal wired infrastructure.

Although not specifically tested against surveillance cameras, in theory, by destabilizing Wi-Fi connections, Shadow Bubble ELITE could potentially disrupt Wi-Fi-connected cameras and other wireless security systems. While it does not block signals in the same way a full Faraday cage would, it acts as a mobile RF disruption tool capable of overwhelming local wireless environments, offering strategic advantages in rapid entry scenarios. Real-world effectiveness will depend on environmental factors such as distance, obstacles, and the resilience of the target wireless systems.

### Red Team Operations

In covert engagements, preventing external alerts or detection through wireless channels is critical. Shadow Bubble ELITE allows operators to create an active disruption zone where Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi-connected infrastructure are severely impaired. This minimizes the risk of real-time notifications, camera feed uploads, or sensor alerts being successfully transmitted outside the compromised environment. All observations have been verified in controlled lab simulations, and operational use should be tailored carefully to match the technical landscape and rules of engagement.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Contents of `requirements.txt`:
```
psutil
```

---

## üìÇ How To Run

1. Clone or copy the project to your machine.
2. Ensure your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters are connected.
3. Start the script:
```bash
sudo python3 Shadow_Bubble_Elite.py
```

4. Use the arrow keys and spacebar to **select** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters.
5. Press **Enter** after selecting your adapters.
6. Watch the terminal split into:
    - **Left side:** Activity logs
    - **Right side:** System CPU/RAM stats

---

## üîù How To Stop

Simply press **Ctrl+C**  
The script will:
- Stop all jamming processes
- Restore Wi-Fi adapters to **managed mode**
- Safely shutdown without damaging anything

---

## üìã Notes
- Always run as **root** or with **sudo** to access wireless hardware.
- Only use in environments where you have permission.
- Make sure your adapters support **monitor mode** for Wi-Fi jamming.
